        * Multiple [styles](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/citation-styles/) are available. Typically a journal will specify which style to use.
        * Use a citation software such as [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) (paid) [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) (free) to help manage the citations.
    * Ethics
        * Medical data are highly sensitive. The use of medical data is regulated by [laws](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/applicable-laws-and-obligations). 
        * Personal privacy is protected by law [Privacy Act 1988](https://www.myhealthrecord.gov.au/for-healthcare-professionals/howtos/recognise-your-privacy-and-security-obligations).
        * When accessing medical data, one must get the ethics approval from a committee. The considerations of the ethics is summarised [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1906611/).
        * Research that involves **human** is regulated by the [National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research 2007](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018). The committee for human-related ethics is often referred as the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Typically, consents also need to be obtained from the participants to use their data.
